// Scope of a variable is the part of the program where the variable is accessible. Like C/C++,
//  in Java, all identifiers are lexically (or statically) scoped, i.e.scope of a variable can be 
//  determined at compile time and independent of function call stack. 
// Java programs are organized in the form of classes. Every class is part of some package.
//  Java scope rules can be covered under following categories.
